Combinators: CSS selectors that combine selectors in a way that gives them a useful relationship to each other and the location of the content.
Selectors that are written in a way that shows how they are related to each other and where they are being used in the program.
The way they are generally written is like this: '1st selector' 'combinator' '2nd selector'
The reason why we use css combinators is for when we want to target certain sections of content without applying our css to other parts.

Descendant Combinators: The most commonly used one that we may not be aware of. Represented by a single space character (' ') between selectors.  
 There are two selectors used here: The ancestor (the first one) and the descendant (the second one).
Example:
div p{} <-- This would select all paragraphs contained within any div containers, and nothing else.

Child Combinators: Represented by a greater than sign (>), selects only immediate children, not all descendant selectors.
Example: section > p{} <-- This would select all paragraphs within a section that are IMMEDIATE children of the ancestor section selector, so if there was a div p within the section, then they would not be selected by it.

Next Sibling Combinators: Represented by the plus sign (+), this combinator only selects the next sibling in the code line.
Example:
html:

<section>
</section>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
Css:
section + div {} <-- Using the + combinator, this would only select the div element next to our section element, not all of them.

Subsequent Sibling Combinators: Represented by the tilde icon (~), this combinator selects sibling elements of the selector.
If all first elements would be called children of the main body element, then having a selector to identify and choose certain sibling aspects would be useful.
Think of it as if you had to choose a sibling of yours. How would you choose them? Would it be all girl siblings? All left-handed siblings? Siblings that think breakfast is the most important meal of the day?
Example:
html:

<section>
</section>
<div>
</div>
<id>
</id>
Css:
section ~ div {} <-- Using this combinator, it would select all div siblings in the code, but nothing else.
